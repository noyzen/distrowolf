## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you run DistroWolf, you need to have the core dependencies installed on your system:

1.  **[Distrobox](https://distrobox.it/usage/installation/)**: The star of the show.
2.  **[Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation)** or **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)**: A container runtime for Distrobox to use.

### Installation & Running

To get DistroWolf running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/noyzey/distrowolf.git
    cd distrowolf
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run in development mode**:
    This will start the Next.js development server and the Electron app.
    ```bash
    npm run electron:dev
    ```

### Building the Application

To create a distributable package (like an AppImage for Linux), run the build command:
